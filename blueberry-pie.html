		<h3>Description</h3>
		<p>This blueberry pie recipe is not runny and has a mystery ingredient that
			adds a nice twist. I came up with this tasty version while searching the
			spice cupboard for nutmeg. My family loved it so much that I made two more
			pies the next day! Serve with whipped cream or ice cream.</p>

		<h3>Ingredients</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>1 (14.1 ounce) package double-crust pie pastry, thawed</li>
			<li>5 cups fresh blueberries (preferably wild)</li>
			<li>½ cup white sugar</li>
			<li>¼ cup all-purpose flour</li>
			<li>½ teaspoon ground cinnamon, or more to taste</li>
			<li>¼ teaspoon almond extract</li>
			<li>¼ cup butter, cut into small pieces</li>
			<li>1 tablespoon milk (Optional)</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>Steps</h3>
		<ol>
			<li>
				Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Press 1 pie crust into
				the bottom and sides of a 9-inch pie pan; set aside.
			</li>
			<li>
				Stir together blueberries, sugar, flour, and cinnamon in a large bowl.
				Add almond extract; stir to coat. Pour blueberry mixture into the prepared
				pie crust.
			</li>
			<li>
				Dot blueberry mixture with butter pieces. Top with second pie crust,
				crimping the edges together to seal. Brush top crust with milk. Use a knife
				to cut slits into the top crust for steam to escape while baking. Wrap the
				edges of the pie with aluminum foil to avoid burning.
			</li>
			<li>
				Bake in the preheated oven for 25 minutes. Remove foil; continue baking
				until filling is bubbling and crust is browned, 20 to 25 more minutes. Cool
				before serving.
			</li>
		</ol>
