		<h2>The best, fudgy one bowl cocoa brownies! A special addition gives these
			brownies a super fudgy centre without losing that crispy, crackly top!</h2>
		<p>What if I told you that you DON’T need to melt chocolate or chocolate chips
			with butter together to make brownies, AND you don’t need two separate bowls.
			Just one bowl and 5 minutes bringing it all together to make the BEST
			brownies you’ve ever eaten in this lifetime. The best part is they’re only
			144 calories EACH! Better than the usual 356 calorie brownies, am I
			right?</p>
		<p>After testing what feels like a lifetime of brownies, these FINALLY came
			out a perfect texture, and have been made weekly ever since. The one
			ingredient I add to these brownies that is different from most recipes is a
			small amount of oil. The oil is JUST enough to keep the centres extremely
			fudgy, without compromising the crispy, crackly crust you can see in these
			photos.</p>

		<h3>Ingredients</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>1/2 cup unsalted butter, melted and HOT</li>
			<li>1 Tbsp cooking oil, (coconut oil is fine)</li>
			<li>1-1/8 cup superfine sugar (caster sugar, or white granulated sugar can be
				processed finer)</li>
			<li>2 large eggs</li>
			<li>2 tsp pure vanilla extract</li>
			<li>1/2 cup all purpose flour</li>
			<li>1/2 cup cocoa powder</li>
			<li>1/4 tsp salt</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>Steps</h3>
		<ol>
			<li>Preheat oven to 350°F.</li>
			<li>Lightly grease an 8-inch square baking pan with cooking oil spray. Line
				with parchment paper (or baking paper); set aside.</li>
			<li>Combine hot melted butter, oil and sugar together in a medium-sized bowl.
				Whisk well for about a minute. Add the eggs and vanilla; beat until lighter
				in colour (another minute).</li>
			<li>Sift in flour, cocoa powder and salt. Gently fold the dry ingredients
				into the wet ingredients until JUST combined (do NOT over beat as doing so
				well affect the texture of your brownies).</li>
			<li>Pour batter into prepared pan, smoothing the top out evenly. (OPTIONAL:
				Top with chocolate chunks or chocolate chips.)</li>
			<li>Bake for 20-25 minutes, or until the centre of the brownies in the pan no
				longer jiggles and is just set to the touch (the brownies will keep baking
				in the hot pan out of the oven). If testing with a toothpick, the toothpick
				should come out dirty for fudge-textured brownies.</li>
			<li>Remove and allow to cool to room temperature before slicing into 16
				brownies.</li>
		</ol>
